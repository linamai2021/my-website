In 2005, Dian Blomquist, a neighbor, had the idea to use the derelict, homeless encampment mini-park on top of the Broadway Tunnel and the entrance to the DPW Tunnel maintenance area for a children and seniors garden. Programs would focus on children learning about nature and where their food comes from as well as increasing their self-esteem.
Dian approached Supervisor Aaron Peskin. He liked the idea and arranged a meeting with Mohammed Nuru of DPW which owned the property. In July 2007, with their financial legislative support, the funds became available and the actual planning with DPW staff of the improvements to the garden began.
September 2009, Broadway Gardens opened with three gardening groups. DPW provided concrete retaining walls and stairs, including a beautiful fence surrounding the garden. Dian began to fundraise from friends, neighbors, Russian Hill Neighbors, SF Parks Trust, SF Beautiful and Kaiser Permanente. Additional retaining walls were built creating spaces for five garden users as well as a picnic table, compost bin, storage bins and soil for the gardening plots.
From 2005 to 2017, Dian Blomquist established and coordinated the gardens. Chinatown Community Development Center took over the responsibilities for the garden after she retired. The gardens continue to provide low income families, seniors and kids a way to connect with nature and grow flowers and vegetables.
Broadway Gardens is a unique sunny green spot in the middle of a densely populated part of San Francisco mainly benefiting low income residents of the neighborhood.
