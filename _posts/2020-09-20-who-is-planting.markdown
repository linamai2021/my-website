Who is planting at the garden? 
 
The Broadway Gardens Project is an intergenerational-community effort to create a healing space for youth and families living in Single Room Occupancies (SROs) and to raise community awareness on environmental justice by building a stronger community through gardening. This project, located at Himmelmann Place and Broadway, serves seniors, children, as well as the SRO community as an open space for community building and healing, where youth and seniors are able to build community through shared cultures, histories, and stories. Crops grown will be used in intergenerational activities and events to serve the community. We aim to have the garden be a continuous project where ownership of the garden belongs to the community participants and that youth gardeners provide the necessary space, resources, and education. Workshops about sustainable gardening techniques will be researched by youth leaders and passed down to the community participants.
